# Operations

How to configure and observe the AutoCanvas server. This page grows with the server; database,
master key and backups are added in later S1 steps.

## Configuration

The server reads its settings from these sources; a later source wins over an earlier one:

1. `appsettings.json` next to the server
2. `appsettings.{Environment}.json` (environment from `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT`, default
   `Production`)
3. environment variables starting with `AUTOCANVAS_`
4. command-line arguments (`--Server:PublicUrl=https://…`)

Environment variables follow the .NET convention: `AUTOCANVAS_` followed by the setting's path with
`__` (two underscores) between the parts. `Server:PublicUrl` becomes `AUTOCANVAS_Server__PublicUrl`.

A few frequently used settings also have a short name. If both forms are set, the long form wins.

| Short name | Setting | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTOCANVAS_URLS` | `urls` | Addresses the server listens on, e.g. `http://+:8080` |

Settings are checked when the server starts. An invalid value stops it with a message that names the
setting and what is expected, instead of failing later on first use.

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `Server:PublicUrl` | none | Absolute `http`/`https` URL users reach the server at, if it differs from what the server sees behind a reverse proxy |

## Health endpoints

| Endpoint | Answers `200` when | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| `/health/live` | the process runs | container liveness probe; restart when it fails |
| `/health/ready` | every readiness check passes (database from S1 step 3) | load balancer / readiness probe; `503` while not ready |

Both return a short JSON document with the overall status and the status of each check, never
error details: those are in the log.

## Logging

The server logs to standard output as one JSON object per line (timestamp in UTC, level, category,
message and structured values), ready for any log collector. For reading logs by hand, set
`Logging__Console__FormatterName=simple` (the `Development` environment does this by default).
Log levels are set per category under `Logging:LogLevel`, for example
`Logging__LogLevel__Default=Debug`.
